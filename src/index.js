// FUNCTION TO UPDATE THE TEMPERATURE WITH AN API CALL BASED ON THE CITY THAT HAS BEEN SEARCHED
// creating a new function called searchCity which will receive a city name and based on that it will update with the corresponding temperature
// creating a separate function for this due to a concept in computer science "the separation of concerns" i.e. we want something to do only one thing and do it well
// using the she codes API documentation https://www.shecodes.io/learn/apis/weather
function searchCity(city) {
  // make an API call and update the UI
  let apiKey = "145at3bd88ddc4bf6od1483d03f4ef43";
  let apiUrl = `https://api.shecodes.io/weather/v1/current?query={${city}&key=${apiKey}&units=metric`;
  //   can test this works by console logging and seeing if the URL appears when search for a city in the console log which when you click on the URL can see the data
  //   console.log(apiUrl);
  //   making the request i.e. getting the results of this API using axios so that we can update the temperature for the searched city
  axios.get(apiUrl).then(refreshWeather);
}

// FUNCTION TO UPDATE THE CITY H1 HEADER FROM THE SEARCH
// putting the function at the top for the search button
// this wil receive an event (from the event listener done below, i.e. 'submit')
// this function will be called eery time we submit due to the event listener later
function handleSearchSubmit(event) {
  // first thing to do is to prevent the default behaviour i.e. the reloading of the page or going to the action of the form (but in this case we don't have the 'action' as we removed that from the form html tag)

  //   getting the value of the search input
  let searchInput = document.querySelector("#search-form-input");
  //   checking it is correrctly logging what we input in the search bar
  //   console.log(searchInput.value);

  // LATER MOVED the below up into the searchCity function so that it updates with the actual name data from the API rather than just the user's typed searched city input]
  //   THIS IS BECAUSE even if we then searched for e.g. Miami like MiAMi, that will still search for this city correctly with the API but it will display the city name correctly in the H1 without all the random uppercase etc
  //   now we want to replace the h1 header i.e. the city name with whatever we've searched for
  //   let cityElement = document.querySelector("#city");
  //   this replaces what ever is inside the h1 element with the value entered in the search bar
  //   cityElement.innerHTML = searchInput.value;
  //   sending the city that has been searched also to the function which will call the API so the temperature can be based on the searched city
  searchCity(searchInput.value);

// to be able to have the city name update with what we searched in the text box
// we need to have an id on the form so we can target it from javascript - id = "search-form"
let searchFormElement = document.querySelector("#search-form");
// to check we have selected the correct element
// console.log(searchFormElement);

// adding an event listener - whenever we submit this form which happens when we click on the search button or press enter on the keyboard
// then we will call this function handleSearchSubmit which we will create at the top of the code
searchFormElement.addEventListener("submit", handleSearchSubmit);

// when we reload, this will have london by default
searchCity("London");

// FORECAST
/* if we used the previous technique of adding id selectors to everything and all the days for the forecast section,
that would have way too many id's and become very cumbersome selecting everything.
So we are going to use a more advanced technique here. We are instead going to inject
all this code from javascript itself. For this we have to learn something called the Javascript templating - the ability to 
inject really long HTML from our javascript */

// can't use the double quotes "" as that only lets you put one line in so have to use the back tick syntax ``:
/* doing the below creates just the one day forecast - we could copy and paste it lots of times like we originally did in the 
but this creates a lot of hard to maintain code and we don't want to repeat ourselves (DRY - don't repeat yourself) so ideally we
want to inject this once and then go through a loop to inject this 5 times so we get the forecast for the 5 days */
